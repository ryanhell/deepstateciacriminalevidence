                <ul className="text-xl list-inside list-decimal">
                    <li>I did offer to pay. They demanded CASH. They would not make reasonable accomidations like allow me to call to have it brought, since oddly only our phones would not work out there. This violates multiple state and federal statutes.</li>
                    <li>Multiple times I asked for the tow or imppound paperwork citing the MEDICAL EMERGENCY!</li>
                    <li>They keep calling eberuone of them "good samaritans" even though they each and all demanded 10000 dollars cash for their service... which is 4 times higher than market value if they even were upfront initially that an ambulance cost cash and they were sendinjg someone to STEAL my truck and put a wheel that us much smaller and older with a dry rotted tire on it.</li>
                    <li>I had just spent over 8 hours in direct sunlight heavily exerting myself desperately trying to save a dying passenger then these dispatchers lie promising an ambulance and then ambush me with a bogus repair bill... I am not allowed to pay it. They wont give me a bill, nor will they allow me to leave with my passenger for a taxi to get help nor will they let EITHER of us call anyone. Its called kidnapping, plane and simple. And yes, its VERY serious. And they all know this. But they never expected me to escape alive.</li>
                    <li>Abundent tampering video evidence easily indicated by audio de-synch</li>
                    <li>Missing 911 audio and a pecuiliar rash of inadequate counsel who scuttled my case intentionally, thus losing key evidence and blocking me from preserving forensics evidence to prove videp tampering</li>

                    <li>Felony threats require a specific threat of violence towards a person. Their fabricated lie that I said I would "go and get a gun and come back and shoot up the place" is arguably not felonmy level.</li>
                    <li>Jenna assured the deputy that the threat was captured on video. No threats by me were captured on video.</li>
                    <li>Incorrect Tow Co Named By Both Dispatch and Later Deputies</li>
                    <li>Failure to gain my authorization needed to touch my vehicle.<p className="text-sm">{`(`}that pesky detail where they stole my vehicle{`)`}</p></li>
                    <li>The FCC prohibits 911 dispatchers from engaging in anything besides life and limb or significant potential for loss of property..roadside is explicitly forbidden....</li>
                    <li>Lack of Tow, Impound; or other chain of custody of vehicle; it was sent home with passenger driving it</li>
                    <li>Tow truck owner driving my vehicle to Jeremiahs not towing it.</li>
                    <li>Jenna being seen entering Rivercom's secure entrance using swipe card and they claim she has never worked there</li>
                    <li>Tow and Dispatch and Operastion Manager all demanded 1000 dollars e</li>
                    <li>Call deescalation done without explination or assessment. Critical life threatening medical emergencies were reported and they refused to address or assess.</li>
                    <li>Why would we go to Jeremiahs house if a tow truck was coming? When is that a thing?</li>
                    <li>Jeremiah Johnson lying about his emppoyment Rivercom employee; then I find out he is Rivercom's Operations Manager. 4th of Juy and Op Man has that kind of time on hand?</li>
                    <li>Jenna lying saying she works for and was working that day at the time of "rescue", for Rivercom</li>
                    <li>Jenna being seen in original video; laughing and telling Jeremiah how she hung up on me, while I am in the background panicking to call 911 back and ask for helo with these maniacs.</li>
                    <li>The video shows me desperately trying to call 911 and get City of Wenatchee or State Patrol or any authority onsite because they have taken my keys at that popint and ordered me to leave the property and leave my passenger whom never was assessed or treated, and now they deny she even had any problem.</li>
                    <li>Jenna on the evidence video declaring that my passenger was close to dying saying if I waited another hour to call she would have died.</li>
                    <li>The passenger who is the ONLY reason I called 911, is never assessed, not even NAMED in any document.</li>
                    <li>Physical threats made by Jenna in evidence video to "slap the shit out of me.</li>
                    <li>Jeremiah noted to have CCW and weapon; he doesnt seem to be scared of me. </li>
                    <li>My truck was able to drive out to drive home simply needed air; contradicting any repairs they claim I needed.</li>
                    <li>In the disposition by Jeremiah he states he declined money I offered yet Jenna is on the video demanding 1000 cash "this is for US" for "driving there to rescue you"</li>
                    <li>The odd detail of a VIP Bagshaw, who was told by Jeremiah to leave the property because Sheriffs wont enter until she leaves.</li>
                    <li>The Chelan Superior Court stenographer was at the scene and introduced as Jeremiahs mother, multiple times to me.</li>
                    <li>Extortion for demanding 1000 dollars cash for said unauthorized repairs as they have called these.</li>
                    <li>My truck being sent out with passenger after simply airing up my original tire which i pulled immediately when low, which reinforces my claim of FRAUD and THEFT.</li>
                    <li> False statements made by deputies who I witnessed in video being informed by the tow op on scene that A I owed him no money. B He never towed my truck, he drove it.</li>
