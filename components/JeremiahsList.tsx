            <li> Jeremiah's role was essentially required to access Rivercom assets used to kidnap my party upon our duress.</li>
            <li> The incident was genuinely wholesome in that the crisis which initiated our need was not permiated by these bad actors, as far as I can tell</li>
            <li> Jeremiah is a highly trained ADMINISTRATOR for a highly regulated 911 center: he knows better than anybody the severity of the crimes he voluntarily was engaged in.</li>
            <li> Jeremiah knew I had him dead to rights and he attempted to HAVE ME MURDERED by swatting me, using his personal ally a Chelan County Deputy.</li>
            <li>Rivercom is not some small town yokles dispatcher. They serve all of Chelan and Douglas county. They are TRUSTED with millions of lives every day. While my incident might be the first; this is what is concerning; their response, their attempt to cover it up by harming me further. And their absolute lack of transparency and accountability. An almost instant revision of their legal clauses on the rivercom911 website went crazy just days after this incident. The policy went from 4 sentences and ballooned to several PAGES.
