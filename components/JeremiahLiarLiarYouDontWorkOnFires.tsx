                                Jeremiah isnt just the OPERATIONS MANAGER of Rivercom 911: He's also a firefighter. As underfunded and understaffed Rivercom claims to be in recent years with an overwhelming amount of calls they cant handle according to recent press: Jeremiah was more critically needed to patrol and roam the desert roads alongside his wife who is also a dispatcher. The two of them were able to take the busiest day of the year for the dispatch company, and tend to fire watch as a husband wife duo... oO

                                        And the fires were so significant that while on call he and his dispatcher wife Jena were able to volunteer themselves, while already voilunteering; to go rescue two stranded motorist... AND BRING THEM TO THEIR PERSONAL HOME. Cause thats what you do when youre already committed to firewatch and it has pulled you away from your director and operations manager jobs at the undermanned and extremely vulnerable "emergency status" 911 center ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.

They anmounced recently they are in a LEVY to drum up emergency funding to stay online...<br></br>...but lets just let the veteran tech and current SENIOR Operations Manager and his wife take the 4th of July off so they can go do firewatch or brush firefighting.... if it should occur.

They are in effect participating in the organized and violent suppression of a legal law abiding citizen who has provided substancial tips to expose corruoption on both coast. This incident was a hit on me whether these other people were aware. Given Johnsons' conduct and choices I think murder was well within their scope from the time they refused our ambulance on the phone. Matter of fact, other state workers road past us as I struggled to make it down the canyon. and after expressing my grave situation. they said that sucks and rode off after refusing to relay our emergency to officials. This was clearly criminal and demonstrated clear deadly intent as well. </text><br></br>

                                They confirm my discovery about Jeremiah's employment as a OPERATIONS MANAGER; that means he is the most senior ranking, highest ranked person who is in charge of the facility and Rivercom operations day to day. Makes their claim of him "having the day off" on the 4th of july; much more dificult to understand or believe.
